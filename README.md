# Novus - MCC

Thanks to all of people who helped me in this project !

## What is it ?

The Novus - MCC is the brand new Mission Control Center from Novus Space, created to help Rockets amateurs to monitor their launches.<br>
The solution is built to update graphs, gauges and other cool stuffs by listening a socket.<br>
This is why I give you a python script that can read serial port from an Arduino for example and send it through a socket, directly connected to the software.

## Usage

Here's somme cool photos of what is look like
